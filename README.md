# ReaDDy tutorials ...
... to be hosted on the [documentation website](https://readdy.github.io/readdy_documentation/index.html)

All notebooks located in this repo must have certain metadata. The metadata is located in the root of the notebook, which
is nothing more than a json string. The required metadata must have the following form:

```javascript
{
  "readdy" : {
    "title": "Simple example",
    "position": "1"
  },
  ...
}
```

Notebook metadata can be edited from the jupyter browser view `Edit > Edit Notebook Metadata`
